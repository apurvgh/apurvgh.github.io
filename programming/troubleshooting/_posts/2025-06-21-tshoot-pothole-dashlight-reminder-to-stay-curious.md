Not every problem needs to be solved with the first idea that comes to mind.

The other day, I hit a pothole. Nothing unusual there. Weâ€™ve all been there. But right after that bump, my windshield washer fluid light lit up on the dashboard. It wasnâ€™t a big deal at first, until I noticed something else.

That light was now blocking my trip meter. And for some reason, that really bugged me.

So whatâ€™s the obvious thing to do?

Just add more windshield fluid, right? Thatâ€™s probably what most people would try. But thatâ€™s not what I did.

#### Curiosity First

Before jumping into a fix, I wanted to understand what was actually going on. Thatâ€™s where real troubleshooting begins.

- Was the washer fluid actually low?
- Were the wipers still working?
- Was there still water in the reservoir?
- And why on earth would hitting a pothole cause this in the first place?

That question stuck with me. Something didnâ€™t add up. I started thinking maybe it wasnâ€™t the fluid at all. Maybe it was a sensor. Maybe a connector came loose from the impact. Could I reach it? Could I fix it myself?

#### A Hands-On Investigation

So I did what any curious person would do. I got under the car to take a look.

Sure enough, I found the sensor. But like most car parts, it wasnâ€™t exactly easy to get to. I would have to remove the underbody mat to see more clearly, and that meant dealing with those tiny plastic pins that tend to snap unless youâ€™ve got extras. I didnâ€™t have any on hand.

I took a good look at the sensor and its wiring. Everything looked intact, although the reservoir was slightly cracked. I tried adjusting the connector wire a bit. Still, I topped off the fluid just in case. Nothing changed. The light stayed on.

At that point, I was pretty confident the sensor had gone bad. Maybe it was already wearing out and the pothole just gave it a final nudge. Either way, it wasnâ€™t reading correctly.

So I went to a local shop and had them disconnect it for now. The light disappeared and I got my trip meter back.

#### More Than Just a Fix

Hereâ€™s the thing. I didnâ€™t actually fix the root issue. But I understood what caused it. And that was enough.

For me, the value wasnâ€™t in pouring more fluid or replacing the sensor right away. It was in breaking down the problem and thinking it through step by step. Thatâ€™s what good troubleshooting looks like.

Itâ€™s not about throwing a quick fix at the issue. Itâ€™s about asking the right questions, ruling things out, testing a few theories, and getting to the root of whatâ€™s really going on.

#### The Takeaway

Whether itâ€™s a broken build, a leaky pipe, or a warning light on your dashboard, the mindset is the same.

Start by being curious. Not rushed.  
Donâ€™t assume. Investigate.

Because when you take the time to understand the problem, the solution usually finds its way to you.

Next time something goes wrong, donâ€™t just fix it. Ask why it happened in the first place. That one question can open up a whole new way of seeing the world â€” and maybe even make you enjoy the problem-solving process a little more.
