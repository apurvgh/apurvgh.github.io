I switched to Devops almost an 8 months ago, but never got around working with builds, release pipelines until recently. My area of interest has been working with SDKs so here I am playing with DevOps API. I am so amazed with the power of customizations you can do with these APIs and customize your pipelines like anything. 

I dedicate this page to all DevOps fans sharing my two cents about the work I have done in recent months.
