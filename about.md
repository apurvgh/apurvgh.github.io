My name is Apurv, I am a father, programmer and a blogger. 
I work for Microsoft as an Embedded Escalation Engineer supporting Dynamics 365 product line. 

I can speak Hindi, English, C#, Java and a bit of python :P. I have dedicated this website to my colleagues, programmers who can benefit from my tips and tricks to program in different languages. 
I do plan to introduce Travel section later which will talk about the places I have visited. I will then share my experiences and tips on lodging, local sightseeing, food and more.. Keep visiting!
